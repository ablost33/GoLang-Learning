# GoLang-Learning
This repository tracks my current explorations/learning of the Go programming language. Most of these programs were written as I followed along Alan A. A. Donovan and Brian Kernighan's book "The Go Programming Language". This repository also contains a repository of katas, containing Go implementations of some well known algorithms. Used this to help me learn.
